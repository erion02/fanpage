        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          Hello, my name is Erion Miftari, and I am a student at Isa Boletini University. This is my personal website dedicated to my favorite football team, FC Barcelona. Barcelona has always been my favorite club because of its rich history, legendary players, and unique style of play. Known as "Mes que un Club" (More than a Club), Barcelona is more than just a football team — it’s a symbol of passion, culture, and excellence that inspires millions of fans worldwide.
          <br><br>
          For me, Lionel Messi is the greatest player of all time. Discovered and developed by Barcelona, Messi’s incredible talent, vision, and consistency have made him not only the face of the club but also a global icon. Alongside Neymar and Luis Suárez, Messi formed the famous "MSN" trio, which I believe is the greatest attacking trio in football history. Their chemistry, goalscoring ability, and teamwork were unmatched, and they helped Barcelona win the treble in 2015, a season that remains my favorite.
          <br><br>
          As for the current Barcelona team, it is a mix of experienced players and young talents working hard to restore the club’s glory. Players like Gavi, Pedri, and Lamine Yamal represent the next generation of stars, carrying the club’s philosophy of beautiful, attacking football. Although it’s a transitional period, I believe this team has the potential to achieve great things and make history once again.
